# Technologies

ortfo/db has a concept of _technologies_. This allows you to specify with what tools the work was made. Note that the term is intended to be very broad-reaching: if you are describing a painting, for example, “oil paint” and “canvas” would be considered technologies. If you are describing a website, “HTML” and “CSS” would be considered technologies.

## Declaration

You can define all valid technologies for your works in a central place with a `technologies.yaml` file.

Then, reference the path to that file in your `ortfodb.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
...
  at: media/

technologies: // [!code focus]
  repository: path/to/technologies.yaml // [!code focus]

tags:
  repository: path/to/tags.yaml
```

The file itself is a list of technologies that have various properties.

### Example

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://ortfo.org/technologies.schema.json

- slug: go
  name: Go
  by: Google
  files: ["*.go"]

  description: |
    An straightforward low-level open source programming language supported by Google featuring built-in concurrency and a robust standard library

- slug: vue
  name: Vue
  aliases: ["vuejs"]
  files: ["*.vue"]
  autodetect: ["vue in package.json"]

### Properties


<JSONSchema :schema :headings="4" type="Technology" />


## Usage

In your work's description file, refer to technologies names by their `slug`, `name` or any of the `aliases`:

```md
---
wip: true
tags: [automation, cli]
made with: [go, vue] // [!code focus]
---

# ortfo
```

## Enforcing correct technologies <Badge type=tip text=Planned />

In the future, ortfo/db might enforce that all technologies used in your works are defined in the `technologies.yaml` file.

This would prevent typos.
